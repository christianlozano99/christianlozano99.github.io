						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>I completed my undergraduate studies at The University of Central Florida, graduating with a
							Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in late 2021. Prior to relocating to Orlando for my
							university education, I resided in Miami, Florida, my place of birth and upbringing. Coming
							from a Colombian household, I am fluent in Spanish, being a native speaker of the language.
						</p>
						<p>

							During my free time, I enjoy a variety of activities that bring me personal enjoyment and
							contribute to my personal and professional growth. Traveling allows me to experience
							different cultures, and appreciate diversity. Gaming stimulates my
							strategic thinking and problem-solving skills. Photography enables me to capture beautiful
							moments. I prioritize fitness to maintain a healthy lifestyle and enhance mental clarity.
							Additionally, I am passionate about AI and web development, continuously learning to acquire
							cutting-edge skills. Currently, I am keen on learning C# with ASP.NET and conducting
							research to implement Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with music.

						<h2>Work History</h2>
						<p>Most recently, I worked at <strong>Nference</strong> in Durham, North Carolina as a Junior Cloud DevOps Engineer. In this role, I gained extensive experience with Azure cloud platforms, Terraform, Puppet, and Ansible, automating infrastructure provisioning and optimizing system performance. My contributions ensured high availability, security, and scalability across multiple environments.</p>
						<p>Before Nference, I worked as a Software Developer at <strong>HCL America</strong> in Cary, North Carolina. At HCL, I honed my expertise in Spring Boot, Angular, and RESTful API development. I focused on building efficient data persistence solutions, improving system scalability, and enhancing user interfaces with CSS and Angular components. My responsibilities also included managing incident response and maintaining critical client portals.</p>
						<p>Prior to HCL, I served as a Software Engineer Intern at <strong>Amazon AWS</strong>, where I worked on the <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/AWS-kumo">AWS Kumo team</a>. I developed a replacement for an existing ETL solution, reducing data ingestion times from hours to seconds. Additionally, I automated workflows with AWS Lambda and CDK, enhancing efficiency and scalability for data processing tasks.</p>
						<p>During my time at the <a href="https://stirlab.org/christian-lozano/">Socio-Technical Interaction Research Lab</a> at the University of Central Florida, I contributed as a UI/UX Developer. My work focused on designing and developing user-friendly interfaces for data collection and annotation tools, which strengthened my skills in front-end development and user experience design.</p>

						<h2>Personal Work</h2>
						<p>During my leisure time, I have been dedicating myself to the development of a centralized
							package management site. Although still in its early stages, I envision this site to be
							highly valuable as it will provide a comprehensive platform for tracking multiple packages
							from various sites. Instead of having to view and manage each package separately, this
							centralized solution will offer convenience and efficiency by consolidating all incoming
							packages into a single interface.

						<h2>Academic Work</h2>
						<p>
							As a student, I had the privilege of enrolling in an exceptional Machine Learning course
							taught by my favorite Professor at UCF, Dr. Hollander. Under his expert guidance, I took on
							numerous engaging Machine Learning projects that not only deepened my practical
							understanding, but also provided me with invaluable insights into the underlying theoretical
							foundations of this field. It was a truly amazing learning experience that expanded my
							knowledge and ignited my passion for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
						</p>
						<p>
							One of my favorite assignments during my academic journey was creating a
							Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This assignment was assigned to me about a year after
							the pandemic and involved building a model capable of classifying and predicting
							the specific type of lung damage depicted in X-ray images. The dataset provided for training
							the model consisted of X-ray images showcasing lungs affected by various conditions such as
							COVID-19, bacterial infections, and damage caused by stress smoking. In addition, a set of
							X-ray images featuring healthy, normal lungs was included. This assignment not only allowed
							me to apply my knowledge in CNNs but also provided a opportunity to contribute to
							the understanding and diagnosis of lung conditions through the power of machine learning.
